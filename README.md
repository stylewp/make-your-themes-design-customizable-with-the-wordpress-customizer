The WordPress Customizer is a great way to tweak the look of a WordPress site. It's especially great for end-users of your themes. They can see their changes in real-time, and don't need to know any coding to customize their site for their own branding. Even better, your theme can add custom settings to the Customizer that will let users go even further in customizing the theme to their own tastes.
